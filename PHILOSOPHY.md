# Philosophy, mission, guidelines and goals

The only info necessary sent to communicate;
beyond starting a program fit to purpose.

Guiding every decision is a perspective of providing high-risk targets
secure and private chat. This, rather than its adoption or competition
with platforms that also do other things, is what makes it interesting
for general purpose use.

Good usability is a corallery of being as secure as possible for anyone.
To lower the entropy of a sane default to only be correct manifest as an
empiric test of intuitions and faculties in interaction occurring between
indiviuals and interfaces.

Given the ability to _lower_ ones security within reason, means being
asked to configure something to _increase_ it, isn't.

Supporting other types of encryption than OTRv4 would add _something_,
and remove the simplicity of ascertaining one goal.

The XMPP protocol was chosen as a platform of smaller XEP possibilities
we try our hardest to keep at a minimum. Also here there are many
established solutions aiming to be fully-featured, where some if not
all of which could be bugs.
